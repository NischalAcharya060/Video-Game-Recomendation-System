# Video Game Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and KNN

## Overview

This project implements a video game recommendation system based on collaborative filtering and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms. The system leverages user preferences and similarities to make personalized game recommendations.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to identify patterns and preferences among users.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Employs KNN to find games that are similar to those liked by a particular user, enhancing recommendation accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare the dataset for recommendation model training.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Implements evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the performance of the recommendation system.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
